E00:
1. Requirements gathering.
2. Include two docs: Functional Requirements(FR) & Technical Requirements(TR). 
3. For FR: make a checklist on functionalities to be built, broken into small modules.
4: For TR: make sure that architecture / framework used can support the technical needs (eg frontend, backend, database).
5. Create Gantt Chart to show how team plans to complete modules and tasks within a time period.

E01:
1. Design a user journey map
2. Aim - create a systematic and standardized data collection process. 
3. Consider as well data type, data format and data organization.
4. Reduce redundancies, duplicates and bad data (missing data, unstructured data).
5. Minimum must include suspect's name, contact person's name and contact details.
6. Identify all mandatory and non-mandatory fields.

E02:
1. Identify high level data patterns(data types?) that might be relevant to the ops team.
2. Create a matching algorithm with parameters for user to perform searches.
3. Come up with a scoring system.
4. Analyze existing leads that are successflly converted to determine trends for the scoring mechanism.
5. (Bonus) identity suspects that require nurturing in order to increase likelihood to become customers.

Demo Day:
1. Show understanding of problem to solve.
2. Show user journey for the app.
3. Present constraints and assumptions made for developing the solution.
4. Live demonstration of the app / wireframe.
5. Detailed explanation of the architecture (how data flows, is stored and shared, what framework used)
